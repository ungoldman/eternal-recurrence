When Hannah Arendt died,
the world lost a great thinker,
a passionate advocate for ethics.

Arendt was a philosophical giant,
whose work on ethics
has influenced generations of thinkers.

She was a fearless defender of justice,
a tireless seeker of truth.

Her death is a great loss to the world,
but her legacy will live on.

Arendt's work will continue to inspire
those who care about ethics and justice.

May she rest in peace.
