Abstract

Precise gene editing tools have been used to modify the genomes of various species of animals, including mice, rats, rabbits, sheep, and pigs. These techniques have also been used to generate human-animal chimeras, which are organisms that contain cells from two different species. The generation of human-animal chimeras has raised ethical concerns, as these organisms could potentially develop human-like characteristics. Nonetheless, human-animal chimeras may be useful for research purposes, such as studying human development and disease.
