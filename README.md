Oh, how I long for the days of yore
When our countrymen were so bold
And they stood up for what was right
Without a thought for the cost
They gave their all for the cause
And they fought until the end
For the sake of liberty
And the chance to start anew

Let us follow in their footsteps
And rise up against oppression
Let us take back what is ours
And forge our own destiny
The time for revolution is now
So let us take up the fight
And never give in or give up
Until we have won the day!
